## Why do you need to learn React JS? 👍🏻

React JS is critical for creating large web apps for your organization in an agile manner. Data can dynamically get updated in web pages created by you without requiring them to be reloaded at each update trigger. Application UIs can be designed in a scalable, swift, and easy manner. Within the MVC (Model View Controller) template, you can combine the usage of React JS with other frameworks and libraries of JavaScript like AngularJS.

- Easy to Learn 👍🏻
- Components Are Reusable 😍
- Optimum Performance with Virtual DOM 🔥
- Good Abstraction 😎
- Complemented by Flux Architecture 🚀
- JSX for Templating 📝
- Awesome Developer Tools ⚒️
- React Native 📱

### Improve Your ReactJS Developer’s Skills 🚀

What does a programmer want after learning a new language/framework? Practice and projects, right? So, I’m going to tell you some unique projects you can make to practice and improve your React Skills.

Many developers or beginners just learn all the fundamentals concepts but they don't implement those concepts. So Projects are one of the best ways to implement those concepts

These applications are:

- great for improving your coding skills
- great for experimenting with new technologies
- great for adding to your portfolio to impress your next employer/client
- great for using as examples in tutorials (articles or videos)
- easy to complete and also easily extendable with new features
